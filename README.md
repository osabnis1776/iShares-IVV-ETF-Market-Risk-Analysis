Market Risk Analysis for S&P 500 Index IVV ETF

Overview

This project conducts a market risk analysis of the S&P 500 Index IVV ETF using Alteryx. The analysis focuses on key market risk indicators such as Value at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES), Sharpe Ratio, and Max Drawdown. This project is designed for an entry-level Data Analyst or Risk Analyst position, emphasizing practical skills in financial analysis and data visualization.

Project Objectives

Import and Preprocess Data: Fetch historical data for the S&P 500 Index IVV ETF from the internet for the last 5 years.
Calculate Key Risk Metrics:
Value at Risk (VaR): Measure the maximum expected loss at a specific confidence level.
Expected Shortfall (ES): Estimate the average loss beyond the VaR.
Sharpe Ratio: Assess risk-adjusted returns.
Max Drawdown: Identify the largest peak-to-trough decline.
Visualize Results: Create visual representations of the calculated metrics using Alteryx.

Project Structure

/data: Folder for raw and processed datasets.
/workflows: Contains the Alteryx workflow files.
/visualizations: Output graphs and visualizations created during the project.
README.md: Project documentation (this file).
